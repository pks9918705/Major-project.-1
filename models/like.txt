likeable: This field represents the thing that is being liked. For example, it could be a specific post or a comment. We use a special type called mongoose.Schema.ObjectId to store the unique identifier of the liked object. Think of it as a special ID assigned to each post or comment in the database. This field is required, which means we always need to provide a value for it.

onModel: This field tells us what type of thing is being liked, whether it's a post or a comment. We store this information as a string, which is simply a sequence of characters. In this case, we only allow two values: 'Post' or 'Comment'. So, when someone likes a post, we set the value of onModel to 'Post', and when someone likes a comment, we set it to 'Comment'. This field is also required, meaning we always need to specify the type of thing being liked.

Now, the interesting part is that the likeable field and the onModel field are connected. We use the refPath property in the likeable field to dynamically reference the model based on the value of the onModel field. This means that when we store the liked object's ID in the likeable field, we also need to specify whether it's a post or a comment in the onModel field. This helps us keep track of which type of object is being liked.
